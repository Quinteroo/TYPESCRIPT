## Introduction
I love this platform; I feel it has been a very useful tool in my learning.
In this repository, I leave all the problems I have solved at different kyu levels.

.
This repository is my TypeScript training ground. 
I add documentation and explanations to it. 
It's also where I keep all the katas I'm solving so I use it like a formula manual.


## Technologies Used
- TypeScript

>[!NOTE]
> You can find the URL, statement, solution, and tests for the katas, as well as code from other programmers that inspired me to find the solution.
